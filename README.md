CharAnalysis-R
=============

An R version of CharAnalysis (the original "CharAnalysis" was developed by Phil Higuera
in Matlab, see https://github.com/phiguera/CharAnalysis).

Here I'm trying to translate Phil's original Matlab code into R language.
The codes have not been tested, yet.
Any use of the R codes is without warranty.
